<strong>Author's Notes:</STRONG> This model was quite easy to build, but the real challenge were the textures. I spent months tweaking them to get them to where they are. During my research on the &quot;real&quot; Deathstar Battle Station I discovered that it is not a perfect sphere and that it is actually shorter than it is wide. I also made all of the rings and bumps on the Superlaser cannon match, and every single gray city sprawl grid thingie actually matches the photo you can find in the Star Wars Technical Journal. If you use this model in an animation or Fan Film please credit me and tell me. Same goes if you use the textures elsewhere or convert the model to another format. Below are instructions for applying the missing textures to the 3DS model file.<BR><p>

<strong><em>Instructions for Applying the Textures</EM></STRONG><BR>
Most of the textures did not remain on the model file after export due to the fact that I used allot of texturing features that are not supported by the 3DS format. Perhaps in the future I will reapply the textures and make it work better. Anywho, this is how you apply the different maps to it.<BR><p>
<strong>Basic Surface Properties</STRONG><BR>
The entire model has a base color of RGB: 136, 136, 136. I also gave it a little surface roughness so that it looks less plasticy. Basically in Animation:Master the values are Height: 10 and Scale: 5. You will have to duplicate this in your preferred app.
<strong>Superlaser Cannon</STRONG><BR>
<IMG SRC="laserref.jpg" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240 ALT="" BORDER="0"><BR>
In the image above you can see that I have created a color-coded render of the Superlaser. Basically apply each map as follows:<BR>
<ul>
<li><font color="red">Red: bump1.tga</FONT>
<li><font color="blue">Blue: bump2.tga</FONT>
<li><font color="yellow">Yellow: bump3.tga</FONT>
<li><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">Purple: bump4.tga</FONT>
<li><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">Aqua Blue: bump5.tga</FONT>
</UL><BR><p>
The file lsclr.tga is a color map applied to the entire Superlaser, except for the outer edge that joins with the rest of the Deathstar surface.
<strong>Equatorial Docking Bay Trench</STRONG><BR>
<IMG SRC="eqref.jpg" WIDTH=310 HEIGHT=266 ALT="" BORDER="0"><BR>
In the image above you can see a profile of the wireframe of the Equatorial trench. I think the maps are still applied in this part, but just in case it didn't work basically all you need to do is have the eqcolor.tga and eqamb.tga maps applied only to the inner surface of the equator, not the little ceiling or floor areas. It is tiled 42 times on the X axis and 1 time on the Y axis. eqcolor.tga is a color map and eqamb.tga is Ambiance map in A:M and I believe MAX calls it a self illumination map.<BR><p>
<strong>The Deathstar Surface</STRONG><BR>
The files amb.tga, color.tga, and bump.tga are applied to the rest of the surface. They also include the outermost ring of the Superlaser cannon (the part that joins it with the rest of the surface) and it is NOT applied anywhere in the trench, including the trench ceiling and floors. Those areas just rely on the basic surface attributes listed above. The color.tga is a color map, the bump.tga is a bump map that needs to be applied with a 75% effect rather than 100%, and the amb.tga is an Ambiance/Self Illumination map that ads the lights to the Deathstar.<BR><p>

That is pretty much it, like I said give credit where credit is due, and if you get the textures applied then please submit to Sci-Fi 3D and lemme know. As we say in the A:M community happy Hashing, MAXing, Lightwaving, Blending, etc. and May the Force be with you!!.
